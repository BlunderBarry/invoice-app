## Commit # 1

Time : 1h30

What I did: Created most of the hmtl templates, did the folder structure, fixed the colors, created some components, fixed some styling.


## Random thoughts:

- Builder.io figma plugins looks incredibly promising as I always found creating the html to be the most boring and tedious part and
starting a new project and it only took me 1h30 min instead of a full day.

- Found an idea to create my first personal project. Will probably start soon...
